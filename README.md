<h1>MariaDB Experiments & Examples Examples</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	MariaDB Experiments & Examples (MEX) contains Examples & Experiments
	on what can (not) be done with MariaDB.
	<br/>
	All the statements have been tested on MariaDB 10, but many of them
	will work on older versions or on MySQL.
	<br/>
	All the statements can easily be adapted to particular use cases.

</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>
	Examples are divided into groups. Every group is in a .sql file.
</p>
<p>
	All examples have an id. The id consists of the uppercase group name,
	followed by a dot and a progressive number.
</p>
<p>
	All files start with the license, followed by a comment which explains
	what kind of examples are in the group.<br/>
	Examples start with a comment with the example's id and a short decription.
	Then, generally, there is another comment which explains how to use the example,
	or why the example works, or what I want to demonstrate with the example.
</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>
	MEX, as a whole, is released under a GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.
</p>
<p>
	However, the individual Examples / Experiments are trivial, so I don't think
	it is possible to apply any license on them.
</p>
<p>
	This means that, if you want to use MEX as a whole, you must follow the GNU AGPL 3
	license; if you want to use an example from MEX, I don't think that the license
	is appliable.
